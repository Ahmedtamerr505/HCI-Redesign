The redesign addressed several critical sections of the platform to improve visual hierarchy and usability:

* **Media Sections:** * **Music & Galleries:** Introduced a modern layout with prominent artwork, high-quality album covers, and elegant grid formats.
    * **Archives:** Developed a dedicated video-based section with an immersive viewer and clean title/description layout.
* **Category & Subcategory Pages:** Implemented an elegant multi-column grid layout and interactive modals for quick content previews (video and image) without leaving the page.
* **Post Details:** Redesigned for high readability with a light background, spacious content presentation, and clear breadcrumb navigation.
